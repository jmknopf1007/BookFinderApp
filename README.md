# My Bookz App

My Bookz is a web application to discover new books, and leave reviews for them<br>
too. The idea for this app was to create a digital database where users can edit<br> 
exisiting book information and update the website with books of their choice.

## How to navigate this program

The program is built to guide you through:<br>
- it will handle all user inputs<br>
- let you know if something was not valid<br>
- you can create a new user account<br>
- you can edit/update account information<br>
- you can delete your account<br>
- you can view all the books in the database<br>
- you can add a new book<br>
- you can edit an existing book<br>
- you can search for books by author name<br>
- you can add a new genre<br>
- you can add a new review for a book<br>
- you can view all the reviews in the database<br>

## Project Status

Currently there is no way to comment on a review. In the next version of<br>
the app I would like to implement that new functionality, as well as potentially<br> 
adding links to buy each book in the database from a separate third party website.
