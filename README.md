# My Bookz App

My Bookz is an online platform to discover new books, and leave reviews for them too.<br>
The idea for this app was to create a digital databse where users can edit exisiting<br>
book information and keep updating the database with new books.

# Project Status

Currently there is no way to comment on a review. In the next version of<br>
the app I would like to implement that new functionality, as well as potentially<br> 
adding links to buy each book in the database from a separate third party website.
